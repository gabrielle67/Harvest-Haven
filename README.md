### Technical Details
Harvest Haven is a Stardew Valley Clone created with Unity during Rob Ager's Udemy course on intermediate 2D game development. Given this was created during a course, I also demonstrated my understanding by explaining how all the scripts work by writing out all the systems created and problems faced when making the game and how they were solved [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19McVkT2cn-rH0Mk5QOAxQ-ZghUwDj0smAmopQ-em1YE/edit?usp=sharing)
